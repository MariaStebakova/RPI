# RPI

Hello! IF you would like have one common repository RPI for all labls you should split this repository on folders (lab1, lab2)

F.E.: create lab1 folder and after that push current changes there

Make wrapper for such components: 
F.E.
  <main>
    <div class="banner">
    <div class="third-box" id="third-left">
    <ul class="pic-box">
    <div class="info-text">
  </main>
      
Also it would be great to use semantic tags SECTION for the list of previous divs

The whole list of css files should be in one common file (for better network (1 request better that 4 (n) request ))

Good to have alt attribute for image tag  

"images/картинка.jpg"  (It's better to have uniq naming for images)

It's only common issues
